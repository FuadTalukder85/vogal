          To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition
          that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original

          If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as
          well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent
          back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.

          Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if

        <p className="text-xs mt-3">
          Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods (such
          as food, flowers, or plants), custom products (such as special orders
          or personalized items), and personal care goods (such as beauty
          products). We also do not accept returns for hazardous materials,
          flammable liquids, or gases. Please get in touch if you have questions
          or concerns about your specific item.

        <p className="text-xs mt-3">
          The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item
          you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase
          for the new item.
